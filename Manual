Apply for an access from FU, if you donâ€™t use it for 4 weeks, it will be automatically gone. You need to apply for it once more. [refer to https://github.com/AlvaroRodriguezDelRio/Curta_metagenomics/tree/main]
After you got access, you can login according the website (you must use FU internet or VPN). You can access by typing ssh user_name@curta.zedat.fu-berlin.de and your password. This will access your /home/user_name directory. the /home partition is small, and should not be used for doing analysis, just to store final results. You can doyour analysis in /scratch/user_name/.

For copying data from / to the cluster, you can use the scp command from your local computer.

For downloading data: scp user_name@curta.zedat.fu-berlin.de:your_data_location_in_curta directory_where_you_want_to_donwload_the_data
For uploading data: scp location_of_the_data user_name@curta.zedat.fu-berlin.de:directory_where_you_want_to_upload_the_data

Something important to do after your sequences arrive is to create a back-up (/scratch/ is not baked-up). You can do that by copying the data to /remote/trove/bcp/rilliglab/, in a directory with your user name.
